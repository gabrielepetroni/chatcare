      "Chatbot: What happens in your life on Wednesdays that you feel like crying? Crying is natural. Crying on Wednesdays may also be natural if some type of regular event or situation comes up for you then that you don't like, feel oppressed by and have no way of avoiding.Maybe you would qualify for a diagnosis for depression.This matters less than what you will do with a diagnosis. Very often people feel some type of relief from hearing a professional tell them what they \"have\".Don't let yourself get talked into taking pills because now you \"have something\". Pills change your mood.Only you can change your life.The diagnosis matters so the therapist gets paid from insurance.It is a good sign that you know whether you feel true emotions or fake ones. This is a clear sign of knowing about yourself.Your mind feeling like a \"maze\" is a little too vague to know if you mean there are too many thoughts at once so that you have difficulty knowing which ones to examine first, or if \"maze\" means you don't know what your thoughts are and feel lost for this reason.Depression which is addressed by a person can become quite liberating because you will remove what bothers you so much in your life that it weighs you down and depresses you.\n",
